# TurboWarp Bookmarklet  
For those that don't know, [TurboWarp](https://www.turbowarp.org) is  
>  
> "...a Scratch mod that compiles projects to JavaScript to make them run really fast. "

You use it by copying and pasting the URL of a Scratch project into a text input box.  
However, it's a pain to have to write the TurboWarp address for every project that relies on TurboWarp, so I made a JavaScript [bookmarklet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet) that opens up a project in TurboWarp, no copying/pasting necessary.  
  
Just highlight and drag the source in this repository into your bookmarks bar and you're ready to go.  
All you have to do to activate it is go to a Scratch project and click it!
